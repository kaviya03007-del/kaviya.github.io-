        <p>A farewell party is a special event to say goodbye. It is held when someone is leaving, like a teacher, a student, or a friend. People gather to celebrate and share happy memories. There are songs, speeches, and sometimes games. Friends give gifts or cards to show love. Everyone feels both happy and sad. Happy because they had good times together, and sad because they will miss the person leaving. A farewell party is a way to say “Goodbye” and “Good luck” for the future. Even if we go far, memories stay in our hearts forever.</p>

        <p>Chess is a board game for two players.[1] It is played on a square board, made up of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares in each row and column. Each player starts with 16 pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king.[2]

The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. When checkmate happens, the player who is being checkmated loses, and the other player wins.[3][4]

During the game, the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move.[4] Because of this, it is mostly agreed that White has a small advantage, and White wins more often than Black in tournament games.[5][6]

Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments. It is enjoyed in many countries, and is a national hobby in Russia</p>
